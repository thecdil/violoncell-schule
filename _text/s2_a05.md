The player puts the first finger in its place in first position, then moves the thumb and hand back a half-step so that the first finger on the A-string goes from B to A-sharp (or, enharmonically respelled, B-flat); in the second case, the half position could be viewed as a lowered first position.

["A-Saite" = "A-string"; "D-Saite" = "D-string"; "G-Saite" = "G-string"; "C-Saite" = "C-string"]
["enharmonisch" = enharmonic respelling]
["Erniedrigte 1ste Position" = "lowered first position"]

It goes without saying that in half position, extended position is not possible, because the first finger is already positioned at the nut and therefore does not move back.
