The following exercises are intended to familiarize the player with shifting between various positions, taking into account the four cases mentioned above. (The positions are labeled half, first, 1 ½, second, third, 3 ½, fourth, 4 ½. These numbers are to be understood as closed hand positions. If extensions are added, so is the abbreviation "gr.")
