title: Note on the Translation

Davidoff was a fluent non-native German speaker whose florid nineteenth-century writing style includes extremely long sentences and many instances of the passive voice. Rather than translating Davidoff's sentences word for word, which might distract readers from their meaning, I have tried wherever possible to simplify them. I also decided against literal translations of cello-specific techniques such as *kleine Spannung* and *grosse Spannung*, opting instead for idioms that any English-speaking cellist would recognize, i.e. "closed position" and "extended position." In this, I am grateful for the advice of my German-speaking father, Roger Wilson, without whom the task would have been far harder.
