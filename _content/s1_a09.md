The following exercises and examples study string crossings on unequal note values. The player must account for the whole-bow, half-bow, and short strokes, and also for the bow speed rules. The "NB" above notes requiring a fast bow-speed is now omitted; the player himself can figure out which notes require it according to the rules. It is a good idea to look through every example before playing and to write "NB" in the relevant places.
